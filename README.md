Implements a scanline algorithm to render pixels from a file of triangle vertices in C++. This is meant to emulate the way a GPU functions through software on the CPU. 

To build the program run the build.sh script, and run the output file a.out. The ws_tris.txt file will be automatically opened by the program.
